# Airline-Problem
This project is based on a problem statement covered as part of our learning curriculum. 
It makes use of various algorithms including those that concern graphs, adjacency matrices, string-matching using Horspool's table, finding the Minimum Spanning Tree, and Sorting.

The above problem statement is solved in 3 files:
(i) client.c- This file includes function declarations and callings, along with test cases to verify each function.
(ii) header.h- This file includes the structure of the various data entities present, along with the functions in the PES1UG20CS091.c file.
(iii). PES1UG20CS091.c- This is the server file and includes all function definitions and the necessary code to run the test cases.
